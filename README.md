- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Mellowtide-CH

- An aspring programmer/game designer interested in RPGs(Baldurs Gate 1 & 2, Pathfinder, Elder Scrolls) /Tactical Combat Games (Jagged Alliance 2, X-Com series)
  and other stat or text "heavy" games. If it got tactical, strategy, RPG or spreadsheet simulator in it's description, I've most likely atleast looked at it :)

- In the future you'll find me at mellowtide.se or mellowtide.eu where I'll be adding my company details as things progress.
